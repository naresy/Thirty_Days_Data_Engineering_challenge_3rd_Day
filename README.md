<h1>Data Partitioning in Data Engineering Using Spark</h1>

<p>This repository contains resources and code examples demonstrating the use of data partitioning in data engineering, specifically using Apache Spark. The project aims to optimize the performance and scalability of big data processing through effective data partitioning strategies.</p>

<h2>Project Structure</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>.ipynb_checkpoints/</strong> - Directory for Jupyter notebook checkpoints.</li>
    <li><strong>Data_Partitioning.ipynb</strong> - Jupyter notebook containing the code and explanations for data partitioning in Spark.</li>
    <li><strong>Employee.csv</strong> - Sample dataset used in the project for demonstrating partitioning techniques.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The project includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An introduction to data partitioning and its importance in big data environments.</li>
    <li>Examples of various partitioning strategies such as range-based and hash-based partitioning.</li>
    <li>Implementation of these strategies using Apache Spark.</li>
    <li>Performance benchmarking to analyze the impact of different partitioning methods on Spark jobs.</li>
    <li>A case study showcasing real-world application of data partitioning for improved efficiency and scalability.</li>
</ul>
